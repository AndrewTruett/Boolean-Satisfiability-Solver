# Boolean Satisfiability Solver Using Non-determinism
## Background
The boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a classic problem in computer science. Given a boolean expression, the question is whether or not there exists a combination of true/false values for the boolean variables of that expression, such that the expression evaluates to true. For example, (a AND b) is satisfiable because there exists a combination of true/false values, namely a is true, and b is true, that results in the expression being true. An example of a non-satisfiable expression is (a AND (NOT a)). This is a contradiction, as there is no possible way to select a true/false value for a such that the expression will evaluate to true.
